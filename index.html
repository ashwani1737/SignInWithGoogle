Step 1: Set Up a PHP Project:
Create a new PHP project or use an existing one. If you don't have a project yet, you can initiate one with the following command in your terminal:

composer init

Follow the prompts to create a `composer.json` file for your project.



Step 2: Install Google API Client Library:
To interact with Google services, you'll need the Google API Client Library. Install it using Composer:

composer require google/apiclient:^2.0





Step 3: Configure OAuth 2.0:
Place the downloaded JSON file containing your OAuth 2.0 client credentials in your project directory. Rename it to `credentials.json`.


Step 4: Create the Sign-In Button:
Create a login button on your login page, allowing users to sign in with their Google accounts. Include the following HTML code:


<!-- Include the Google Sign-In API -->
<script src="https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js" async defer></script>

<!-- Create a div to contain the sign-in button -->
<div class="g-signin2" data-onsuccess="onSignIn"></div>


Step 5: Implement Google Sign-In Callback:
Add the following JavaScript function to handle the Google Sign-In callback. This function will be called when a user successfully signs in.


function onSignIn(googleUser) {

  // Get user details
  var profile = googleUser.getBasicProfile();

  // Access user information
  console.log('ID: ' + profile.getId());
  console.log('Name: ' + profile.getName());
  console.log('Email: ' + profile.getEmail());

  // You can now send this information to your PHP backend for further processing

}



Step 6: Handle the Backend in PHP:
Create a PHP script to handle the information received from the Google Sign-In callback. Extract the user details and perform any necessary authentication or user creation logic.


<?php

// Include the Google API Client Library
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Load client credentials from the file
$client = new Google_Client();
$client->setAuthConfig('credentials.json');

// Get the user data from the front-end
$id_token = $_POST['id_token'];

// Verify the token
$payload = $client->verifyIdToken($id_token);

if ($payload) {

    // Token is valid
    $user_id = $payload['sub'];
    $user_name = $payload['name'];
    $user_email = $payload['email'];

    // Perform actions with the user information (e.g., store in the database, create a session)

    // ...

    // Return a response to the front-end
    echo json_encode(['status' => 'success', 'message' => 'User authenticated successfully']);

} else {
    // Token is invalid
    echo json_encode(['status' => 'error', 'message' => 'Invalid token']);
}

?>
